        <item>Hey welcome to LivePost! LivePost is all about covering news stories in real time and sharing them with the world.</item>
        <item>We\'re going to do a quick walkthrough of how to create a story. Let\'s start off by clicking on “Your 1st Story” to give it a catchy title.</item>
        <item>Awesome! Now click on “Pick a Category” up top to choose what your story is about.</item>
        <item>Looking good! We added an image to your story, but you can change it later by long pressing it and adding your own.</item>
        <item>Ok, so now all that\'s missing is your profile. Click on the profile picture to set it up.</item>
        <item>Nice pic! Now hit “Publish” to choose if you want to publish your story on your blog or on the LivePost News website.</item>
        <item>Great you\’re ready to start telling your story. Let\’s try sending a photo.</item>
        <item>Click on the camera button down below to open your phone\’s camera and take a photo.</item>
        <item>Nice! Tip: Long pressing images will give you several options. Try deleting that last image.</item>
